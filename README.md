# Papers

This repository contains my personal reviews about the papers I read continuously. The idea is to pick a couple of recent papers related to a specific area and then make a coherent and comprehensive summary of them, but also comparisons/critics/ideas that I had during my reading sessions. This allows me to keep updated about recent advances in ML/DL fields.
